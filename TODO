initrd filesystem needs to have real files in it

expand ringbuf to deal with messages rather than just a character stream

message passing system:
	async only - blocks if trying to send to a process with a full message queue
	3 syscalls:
		send_msg(uint32_t dest_tid, uint32_t msg_tag, uint32_t msg_len, void* msg_body)
			send a message to the specified destination thread
			msg_body must be a valid userspace address and will be copied into the other process
			if the remote process's message queue is full, this syscall will block
			returns 0 on success

		try_send_msg(uint32_t dest_tid, uint32_t msg_tag, uint32_t msg_len, void* msg_body)
			like send_msg() but returns immediately if unable to send, rather than blocking

		recv_msg(uint32_t *msg_tag, uint32_t *buf_len, uint32_t* msg_body_len, void* msg_body)
			check for a message waiting in the queue, if one is there receive it into the specified buffer
			if no message is waiting, returns 1
			returns 0 on success
